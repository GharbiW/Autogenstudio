## **Project Overview**  

This project aims to:  
- Test the capabilities of **AutoGen**, a multi-agent LLM framework, in simulating dynamic workflows within a virtual marketing agency.  
- Evaluate the collaboration and problem-solving efficiency of agents equipped with specialized roles and Python-based skills.  
- Optimize task decomposition and execution while maintaining cost efficiency and scalability.  

The framework is tested on various tasks, including landing page creation, content generation, sentiment analysis, and web development, within a structured yet adaptable workflow.

## **Methodology**  

To conduct the experiments:  
- **Framework**: Used **AutoGen Studio**, a low-code platform, to configure dynamic workflows and deploy multi-agent systems.  
- **AI Models**: Leveraged **OpenAI 4-0 Mini** for cost-efficient task execution and **Mistral** for research-intensive operations.  
- **Workflow**: Developed a non-linear, task-specific workflow to ensure agents collaborate only when necessary, minimizing token consumption and enhancing precision.  
- **Challenges Addressed**: Reduced unnecessary interactions, optimized token usage, and ensured high-quality outputs across various scenarios.

## **Agent Roles and Workflow**  

### **Agents**  
- **Creative Agent**: Generates strategies and guides workflows.  
- **Data Analysis Agent**: Processes raw data into actionable insights.  
- **Web Research Agent**: Collects relevant market data and trends.  
- **Content Creator**: Produces marketing copy and articles.  
- **Image Generator**: Designs visuals using DALL-E 3.  
- **Web Scrap and Social Media Scrap**: Extract data from websites and platforms.  

**Workflow Highlights**:  
- Agents collaborate dynamically based on task relevance.  
- Information flows systematically from supporting to primary agents, enabling seamless decision-making and execution by secondary agents.

## **Installation Steps**  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
Start by cloning this repository:  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git  
cd repo-name  
```  

### **2. Install AutoGen Studio**  
Download and set up **AutoGen Studio** from its official repository:  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/autogen.git  
cd autogen  
```  

### **3. Set Up a Virtual Environment**  
Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:  
```bash  
python -m venv env  
source env/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux  
env\Scripts\activate     # Windows  
```  

### **4. Install Dependencies**  
Run the following command to install the necessary Python packages:  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

**Example requirements.txt File** (included in the repository):  
```text  
autogen-agentchat[lmm]~=0.2  
openai==1.36.1  
google-api-python-client  
selenium  
beautifulsoup4  
pytrends  
PyPDF2  
textblob  
pandas  
numpy  

```  

Ensure all dependencies are installed for proper execution of agents and skills.  

### **5. Add API Keys**  
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure your API keys:  
```bash  
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key  
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key  
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your_google_search_engine_id  
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
SEMRUSH_API_KEY=your_semrush_api_key  
```  

Load the `.env` file in your Python scripts using `dotenv`:  
```bash  
pip install python-dotenv  
```  

### **6. Start AutoGen Studio**  
To launch AutoGen Studio, run:  
```bash  
python -m autogenstudio  
```  

AutoGen Studio will start a local server and open in your default web browser.  

### **7. Verify Skills Integration**  
Place all pre-built Python skills in the `skills/` directory and test them independently:  
```bash  
python skills/<skill_name>.py  
```  

This expanded section ensures all the required steps for installing **AutoGen Studio**, setting up dependencies, and integrating skills are clear and actionable.

## **Skills Integration**  

### **Available Skills**  
1. **Web Scraping**: Extract structured and unstructured data using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.  
2. **Google Trends API**: Fetch trending data for market analysis.  
3. **YouTube Transcript**: Retrieve transcripts and metadata from videos.  
4. **Image Generation**: Create visuals with OpenAIâ€™s DALL-E 3.  
5. **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluate emotional tones in content using TextBlob.  
6. **Content Analysis**: Process and classify text data.  
7. **PDF Handling**: Extract and save content from PDF files.
